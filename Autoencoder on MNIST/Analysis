The model of the autoencoder was left as is. That is, the same model as Sir Atienza's. As can be seen from the numbers on the resulting restored image, no square patches are visible. The only visible diffrence from the ground truth and the restore image is the sharpness. The ground truth has sharp color and defined edges while the restore image has blurry color and edges. Nevertheless, the digits are very well recognizable. It seems that autoencoders cannot fully restore a image 100%. The benchmark score is high enough to beat the baseline.
